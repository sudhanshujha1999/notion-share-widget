# Notion Share Widget

A simple Notion Share Widget developed such that, it can be plugged in any App with minor configurations.

## Project Details

* In the project, you can share a resource with your team members, groups or organization with different access levels.

* Click on Share button to see who all have what access to that resource.

* To give access to someone new, click on the invite button. 

* This will take you to the search dialog box, where you can search the person and groups.

* once you have selected all the members and groups, simply select the access level that you want to assign them and click Invite.

* Now you can see those selected members and groups on your share dialog with the access level that you assigned them.

## Challenges

I found it a little challenging to make a single connected keyboard accessibility for multiple different list, it was a little tricky. But i was able to solve it.

## Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
